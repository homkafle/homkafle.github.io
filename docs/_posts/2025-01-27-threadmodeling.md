### Introduction

In today’s digital landscape, the increasing frequency of data breaches underscores the critical importance of robust application security. The 2024 HealthEquity incident, where a compromised vendor account exposed the sensitive information of over four million individuals, serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of neglecting security best practices. Modern applications, particularly those operating within cloud environments, are increasingly targeted by sophisticated threat actors.

Organizations are increasingly leveraging cloud-based platforms to enhance operational efficiency and user experience. However, this reliance on interconnected systems has expanded the attack surface significantly. Applications handling sensitive information – such as financial transactions, employee recognition systems, or protected health data – carry a considerable responsibility. Any lapse in security can result in significant repercussions, encompassing financial loss, regulatory penalties, and damage to organizational reputation.

Threat modeling provides a proactive approach to mitigate these risks. By systematically analyzing potential threats and prioritizing critical vulnerabilities, security and project teams can anticipate and address security gaps before they can be exploited. This method allows organizations to strengthen their security posture and safeguard applications against sophisticated adversaries.

However, it is important to acknowledge that traditional threat modeling approaches may not be sufficient to address the complexities of modern, cloud-based systems. These systems are characterized by intricate webs of interconnected components – ranging from operating systems and containers to third-party APIs and cloud services. Overlooking the security implications of any one of these components or their interactions introduces significant vulnerabilities. A seemingly minor flaw within a single element can propagate throughout the system, potentially compromising its integrity. Thus, a more holistic and nuanced approach to threat modeling is paramount.

In this blog, we’ll dive deep into the concept of modern threat modeling through a practical lens. Our goal is to illustrate how to effectively identify and mitigate high-risk threats in a cloud-based application using a structured approach. Specifically, we’ll be using the STRIDE framework to systematically analyze the various building blocks of a hypothetical employee recognition application and identify potential security vulnerabilities. This application allows managers to award points to their high-performing team members, which can then be redeemed for gift cards, making it a prime example of an application requiring robust security measures. By walking through this example, we will emphasize the importance of risk prioritization and focusing on the critical threats that pose the greatest danger to your application and your business. We will not only be covering the basic functionality of this app but also go into a specific abuse case of how the application could be exploited due to a vulnerability.

### Understanding Our Application - The Employee Recognition Platform

In order to effectively apply threat modeling, we must first develop a thorough understanding of the system under scrutiny. In our case, we will be using an example of modern cloud-based application, the “Employee Recognition Platform.” This platform serves as a great illustration to showcase threat modeling use cases. This platform is designed to empower managers to recognize the achievements of their direct reports, fostering a culture of appreciation and positive reinforcement.

#### Overview of the Employee Recognition Platform
The Employee Recognition Platform is a web-based application designed to facilitate the acknowledgment of employee contributions within an organization. It provides two primary user roles:

<b>Managers:</b> Managers can nominate their direct reports for recognition based on their performance and contributions. They initiate the recognition process, selecting the employee, defining the recognition criteria, and awarding points.

<b>Employees:</b> Employees can view their received recognitions and earned points. They can then redeem these points for gift cards from a catalog of available options.

The platform’s core functionalities can be broken down into the following key processes:

<b>Recognition Submission:</b> Managers initiate recognitions for their direct reports, specifying the reason for recognition and awarding points.

<b>Points Allocation:</b> The system tracks and manages the points associated with each recognition awarded. These points are then credited to the receiving employee’s account.

<b>Gift Card Redemption:</b> Employees can browse an available catalog of gift cards and redeem their points for gift cards with a corresponding value, from their account.

<b>User Authentication and Authorization:</b> The platform ensures secure access through user authentication and authorization protocols for both managers and employees.

<b>User Management:</b> The platform also handles the addition, modification, and termination of users within the system, while also allowing the management of organizational hierarchy.

This platform is designed to streamline the recognition process, automate point management, and offer a seamless gift redemption experience, all while maintaining a secure and efficient system.

#### High-Level Architecture Diagram

To understand the complexity of this platform, it’s helpful to visualize its architecture. The following is a description of a block diagram representing the main components and the flow of interaction between these components:

User Interface (Web/Mobile App): This is the primary interface for both managers and employees. It provides a user-friendly way to interact with the platform’s features.

API Gateway: All requests from the User Interface to the backend services pass through the API Gateway. This serves as a single entry point for all API traffic.

<p><center>Figure : Architecture diagram of Employee Recognition Platform.</center></p>

<b>Authentication Service:</b> Responsible for authenticating users and verifying their identity before 4›4››granting access to the platform.

<b>Recognition Service:</b> Manages the creation, storage, and retrieval of recognition submissions. It handles the logic for sending and listing the recognitions.

<b>Points Service:</b> Tracks employee point balances, awards points for recognitions, and handles point deductions for gift card redemptions.

<b>Gift Card Redemption Service:</b> Provides the interface for employees to redeem their points for gift cards. Interacts with the third-party gift card vendor via an API, to obtain the available catalog of gift cards and to finalize redemptions.

<b>Database(s):</b> Responsible for storing all the application data which include the users, their recognition, points and other data.

As our focus is on security, some critical data and processes within the platform are worth noting:

<b>Sensitive Data:</b>

<b>User Credentials:</b> Passwords and authentication tokens, which must be protected from unauthorized access.

<b>Employee Data:</b> Personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, employee IDs, and organizational structure, requiring compliance with data privacy regulations.

<b>Points Balances:</b> Employee points balances, are a financial data that are subject to fraud and should be carefully managed.

<b>Gift Card Information:</b> Redemption codes and transaction details are a financial data requiring high security.

C<b>ritical Processes:</b>

<b>User Authentication and Authorization:</b> Ensures only authorized users can access the platform.

<b>Recognition Submission:</b> Must be secure to prevent fraudulent recognitions.

<b>Points Awarding and Management:</b> Requires integrity and accuracy to prevent fraud.

<b>Gift Card Redemption:</b> Ensures correct redemption and prevents theft.

#### Why This is Important:

Understanding the architecture of our platform is the first step in identifying potential vulnerabilities. By mapping out the different components, their functions, and their interactions, we are better positioned to assess the platform’s overall security posture.

let’s move forward with threat modeling the high-priority areas of the Employee Recognition Platform. We’ll use the STRIDE methodology to analyze threats, focusing on the key building blocks identified in the architecture diagram. Remember, we identified these as our initial focus:
