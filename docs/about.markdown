If you’ve never tried summarizing yourself in an “About Me” page, give it a go—it’s a surprisingly introspective and rewarding exercise. This space is my attempt to distill my journey so far and share a little of what I’ve learned along the way.

My name is Hom Kafle, and I’m an information security professional, engineer, and lifelong learner currently based in Texas. With over a decade of experience in offensive and defensive security roles, I specialize in application and product security, helping organizations build resilient systems in an increasingly complex digital landscape.

This blog is both a passion project and a long-term endeavor, a place where I plan to organize and share my knowledge about application security, penetration testing, broader topics in cybersecurity, and some personal experiences. While it began as a way to document my learning, I plan to grow it into something more—ideally, a platform for exploring ideas, engaging with a global community, and contributing to the broader field of information security.
